1)Medical image datasets:

-Skin cancer dataset: is the first group of dataset sourced from
Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-
benign, which encompasses images belonging to two distinct
classes: Benign (class 0) and Malignant (class 1). This dataset
comprises 2637 training images, with 1440 falling under the
Benign category and 1197 under the Malignant category. Ad-
ditionally, there are 660 test images, consisting of 360 Benign
and 300 Malignant examples. Each image in the dataset is of
dimensions 224 × 244 pixels.


-Breast cancer dataset is the second group of datasets sup-
ported by Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/ultrasound-
breast-images-for-breast-cancer, which has 8116 training images, with 4074
Benign and 4042 Malignant samples. Also, we have access to
900 test samples, 500 in the Benign category and 400 in the
Malignant category. Each image in the dataset is of dimensions
224 × 244 pixels.


-chest X-ray dataset is a chest X-ray image dataset extracted
from a publicly available database 3. In our experiments, 5216
images for the training dataset are available, with 1341 for the
normal category and 3875 for the Pneumonia category. The
dataset includes 624 images for the testing phase, with 234 for
the normal category and 390 for the Pneumonia category. Each
image in the dataset is of dimensions 224 × 244 pixels.


2)Gene editing datasets:

-CRISPOR database: organized and maintained by Haeussler
et al. Haeussler et al. (2016) aggregates widely popular pub-
lic datasets for quantifying on-target guide efficiency and detect
off-target cleavage sites. The dataset consisted of 18211 train-
ing images and 7806 testing images of dimensions 8×23 pixels.


-GUIDE-seq: is one of the first off-target data repositories,
based on the results of the GUIDE-seq technique developed by
Tsai et al. Tsai et al. (2015). It can serve as an accurate frame-
work for genome-wide identification of off-target effects. The
sgRNAs used in GUIDE-seq target the following sites: VEGFA
site 1, VEGFA site 2, VEGFA site 3, FANCF, HEK293 site
2, HEK293 site 3, and HEK293 site 4, in which 28 off-targets
with a minimum modification frequency of 0.1 were identified
(among 403 potential off-targets). Each image in the dataset is
of dimensions 8 × 23 pixels, and the dataset includes 309 train-
ing images and 133 testing images.
